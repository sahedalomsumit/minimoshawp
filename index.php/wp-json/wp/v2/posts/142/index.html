Since the demand is high, Garuda may soon begin operating a direct flight between the two countries.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As of now, it appears that Bali will soon be reopening its doors to Japan.

Other practices, such as bowing rather than shaking hands, may have played a role.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Japan is also known for its hermit culture. It\u2019s estimated there are more than half a million Japanese \u201chikikomori,\u201d a term that refers to a person who chooses a reclusive lifestyle.
