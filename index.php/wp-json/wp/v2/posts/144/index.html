Even if the passenger continues to travel to another city, coverage remains intact.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Travelers are able to enjoy a comfortable, safe trip without any unforeseen problems. If diagnosed with COVID-19 while traveling, Flydubai covers the first 150,000 euros of medical expenses.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, some of the quarantine costs are covered as well. If a passenger is placed in quarantine, Flydubai covers up to 100 euros of quarantine expenses per day.Flydubai Makes It Easier to Travel During the COVID-19 Pandemic<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.travelinglifestyle.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/flydubai-free-covid-insurance-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Other than offering global coverage to passengers, Flydubai is also taking other steps to protect passengers during the pandemic. In September, the company announced that passengers would be eligible for&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.flydubai.com\/en\/plan\/covid-19\/pcr-test-reduced-rates\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">discounted COVID-19 PCR tests<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Passengers only have to submit their booking confirmation and identification to get a discounted test. The test results are normally available within 48 hours, but special clinics can provide results in 24 hours.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to these efforts, Flydubai is now able to resume normal operations. In late November, the airline achieved its first scheduled commercial flight from Dubai to Tel Aviv.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Flydubai is making flights during the COVID-19 pandemic a little easier for passengers around the world.
